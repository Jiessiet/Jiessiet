#### Hi, my name is Jiessie. I am currently a Master's student at the University of Toronto. My research is on understanding and improving collaboration in software engineering by building human-centric tools.

I also did my undergraduate program at UofT, in Computer and Cognitive Science.

# Research projects
## LLM failures in Software Engineering
Empirical research into the use of ChatGPT for a novel SE task. The goal is to understand SE users' usage, failures, and mitigation strategies for ChatGPT programming. (In submission)
[LLMs are Imperfect, Then What? An Empirical Study on LLM Failures in Software Engineering] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09916)

## Team-AI Collaboration in a Hackathon
Investigating how LLMs are being used and adapted in a hackathon environment. Aims to understand the collaboration between humans, and LLMs and how LLMs are being adapted to workflows.
