Unified approaches to programming and theoretical problems.

## Year Two Courses
### COG250 - Cognitive Science

Interrelations among the philosophical, psychological, linguistic and computer science aspects of the field are emphasized.

### CSC207 - Software Design
> An introduction to software design and development concepts, methods, and tools using a statically-typed object-oriented programming language such as Java. Topics from: version control, unit testing, refactoring, object-oriented design and development, design patterns, advanced IDE usage, regular expressions, and reflection. Representation of floating-point numbers and introduction to numerical computation.

### STA220 - Practice of Statistics I
> An introductory course in statistical concepts and methods, emphasizing exploratory data analysis for univariate and bivariate data, sampling and experimental designs, basic probability models, estimation and tests of hypothesis in one-sample and comparative two-sample studies. A statistical computing package is used but no prior computing experience is assumed.

### CSC209 - Software Tools & Systems Programming
> Software techniques in a Unix-style environment, using scripting languages and a machine-oriented programming language (typically C). What goes on in the operating system when programs are executed. Core topics: creating and using software tools, pipes and filters, file processing, shell programming, processes, system calls, signals, basic network programming.

### PSY270 - Introduction to Cognitive Psychology
> An introduction to research and theory on the neural and cognitive architecture of attention, memory, language, thinking and reasoning.

### CSC236 - Introduction to Theory of Computing
> The application of logic and proof techniques to Computer Science. Mathematical induction; correctness proofs for iterative and recursive algorithms; recurrence equations and their solutions; introduction to automata and formal languages.

### PSY240 - Introduction to Abnormal Psychology
> A critical survey of concepts, theories, and the state of research in the area of psychopathology and therapeutic methods.

### STA255 - Statistical Theory
> This courses deals with the mathematical aspects of some of the topics discussed in STA220H1. Topics include discrete and continuous probability distributions, conditional probability, expectation, sampling distributions, estimation and testing, the linear model 

### PHL245 - Modern Symbolic Logic
> An introduction to formal deductive logic. Semantics, symbolization, and techniques of natural deduction in sentential logic. Symbolization, natural deduction, and models in monadic predicate logic. Symbolization and natural deduction with polyadic predicates. Introduction to advanced concepts in first-order logic, such as operations, identity, and models.

### PSY290 - Behavioural Neuroscience
> Provides students with a solid background in the biological basis of behaviour. Animal and human research topics will include functional neuroanatomy and neural signalling. Further topics may include sensory and motor control, motivational systems, hormones, and emotions, among other topics.

## Year Three and Higher Courses
### CSC309 - Programming on the Web
> An introduction to software development on the web. Concepts underlying the development of programs that operate on the web; survey of technological alternatives; greater depth on some technologies. Operational concepts of the internet and the web, static client content, dynamic client content, dynamically served content, n-tiered architectures, web development processes, and security on the web. Assignments involve increasingly more complex web-based programs.

### CSC343 Introduction to Databases
> Introduction to database management systems. The relational data model. Relational algebra. Querying and updating databases: the query language SQL. Application programming with SQL. Integrity constraints, normal forms, and database design. Elements of database system technology: query processing, transaction management.

### JLP315 Language Acquisition
> Infants’ abilities at birth, prelinguistic development, the first words, phonological, syntactic and semantic development. Social variables influencing language acquisition, bilingualism, models of development, language play.

### PHL342 Minds & Machines
> Topics include: philosophical foundations of artificial intelligence theory; the computational theory of the mind; functionalism vs. reductionism; the problems of meaning in the philosophy of mind.
